	 * 	- You will receive an immediate zero for this task if the requirement is violated. 
	 * 	- You can define helper methods if you wish.
	 * 
	 * Only write lines of code within the methods given to you. 
	 * Do not declare any variables OUTSIDE the given methods.
	 * You can only declare local variables within each method.

	 * Your submission will only be graded against:
	 * 	- JUnit tests given to you in TestUtilities

	/*	 
	 * Input Parameters:
	 *	- `seq`: an array of integers
	 *	- `indices`: an array of integers (each of which may or may not be a valid index for `seq`) 
	 *
	 * Assumptions:
	 * 	- `seq` may be empty.
	 * 	- `indices` may be empty. 
	 * 	- `indices` may contain duplicates.
	 *  
	 * What to return?
	 *  - For each integer value in `indices`, if it is a valid index for input array `seq`, 
	 *  	then use it to index into `seq` and include the result in the output array.
	 *  
	 *  For example: Say `seq` is {23, 46, 69} and `indices` is {2, -1, 0, 3, 0, 2}
	 *  	(where indices -1 and 3 are invalid, so only indices 2, 0, 0, 2 are used)
	 *   	Then the method should return {69, 23, 23, 69} 
	 *   
	 *  Note: Order of elements in the output array corresponds to the order in which
	 *  		valid indices in the `indices` array are arranged. 
	 *  
	 *  That is, the output array may be empty if the input array `seq` is empty,
	 *  	or if the input array `indices` does not contain any valid indices.
	 *   
	 * See the JUnit tests related to this method.

	 *  
	 * What to return?
	 *  - Return an array that represents an encoding of `seq`, by adopting the following principle:

	 *  		in the input array `seq`.
	 *  	
	 *  	For example, {2, 4, 1, 3} encodes that value 2 (at even index 0) should repeat 4 times (as specified at odd index 1), 
	 *  		and similarly, value 1 should repeat 3 times. 
	 *  		
	 *  		Say `seq` is {2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1}.
